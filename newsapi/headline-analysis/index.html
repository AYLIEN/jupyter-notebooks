<h1 id="News-Headline-Analysis">News Headline Analysis<a class="anchor-link" href="#News-Headline-Analysis">&#182;</a></h1><p>In this project we're analyzing news headlines written by two journalists – a <strong>finance</strong> reporter from the Business Insider, and a <strong>celebrity</strong> reporter from the Huffington post – to find similarities and differences between the ways that these authors write headlines for their news articles and blog posts. Our selected reporters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Akin Oyedele the Business Insider who covers market updates; and</li>
<li>Carly Ledbetter from the Huffington Post who mainly writes about celebrities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Approach">Approach<a class="anchor-link" href="#Approach">&#182;</a></h3><p>We're initially going to collect and parse news headlines from each of the authors in order to obtain a parse tree. Then we're going to extract certain information from these parse trees that are indicative of the overall structure of the headline.</p>
<p>Next, we will define a simple sequence similarity metric to compare any pair of headlines quantitatively, and we will apply the same method to all of the headlines we've gathered for each author, to find out how similar each pair of headlines is.</p>
<p>Finally, we're going to use K-Means and tSNE to produce a visual map of all the headlines, where we can see the similarities and the differences between the two authors more clearly.</p>
<h3 id="Data">Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data">&#182;</a></h3><p>For this project we've gathered 700 headlines for each author using the <a href="https://newsapi.aylien.com">AYLIEN News API</a> which we're going to analyze using Python. You can obtain the Pickled data files directly from the GitHub repository, or by using <a href="https://github.com/AYLIEN/headline_analysis/blob/master/data-collection.ipynb">the data collection notebook</a> that we've prepared for this project.</p>

<p>From this information, we're going to extract the chunk type sequence of each headline (i.e. the first level of the parse tree) and use it as an indicator of the overall structure of the headline. So in the above example, we would extract and use the following sequence of chunk types in our analysis:</p>

<pre><code>['NP', 'PP', 'NP', 'VP']</code></pre>

Next, we need to find a similarity metric that given two chunk type sequences, tells us how similar these two headlines are, from a structural perspective.</p>
<p>For that we're going to use the SequenceMatcher class of difflib, which produces a similarity score between 0 and 1 for any two sequences (Python lists):</p>

<p>The above interactive chart shows a number of dense groups of headlines, as well as some sparse ones. Some of the dense groups that stand out more are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>NP, VP</strong> group on the left, which typically consists of short, snappy stock update headlines such as "Viacom is crashing";</li>
<li>The <strong>VP, NP</strong> group on the top right, which is mostly announcement headlines in the "Here comes the..." format; and</li>
<li>The <strong>NP, VP, ADJP, PP, VP</strong> group at bottom left, where we have headlines such as "Industrial production <strong>falls more than expected</strong>" or "ADP private payrolls <strong>rise more than expected</strong>".</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look closely you will find other interesting groups, as well as their similarities/disimilarities when compared to their neighbors.</p>

<p>Here we observe the same dense and sparse patterns, as well as groups of points that are somewhat unique to each author, or shared by both authors.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bottom right cluster is almost exclusive to the first author, as it covers the short financial/stock report headlines such as "Here comes CPI", but it also covers some of the headlines from the first author such as "There's Another Leonardo DiCaprio Doppelgänger". Same could be said about the top middle cluster.</li>
<li>The top right cluster mostly contains single-verb headlines about celebrities doing things, such as "Kylie Jenner Graces Coachella With Her Peachy Presence" or "Kate Hudson Celebrated Her Birthday With A Few Shirtless Men" but it also includes market report headlines from the first author such as "Oil rig count plunges for 7th straight week".</li>
</ul>
<p>We're sure you can find more interesting observations by looking closely at the above chart.</p>

<h3 id="Conclusion-and-Future-Work">Conclusion and Future Work<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion-and-Future-Work">&#182;</a></h3><p>In this project we've shown how one can retrieve and analyze news headlines, evaluate their structure and similarity, and build an interactive map to visualize them clearly.</p>
<p>Some of the weaknesses of our approach, and ways to improve upon them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using entire parse trees instead of just the chunk types</li>
<li>Using a tree or graph similarity metric instead of a sequence similarity one (ideally a linguistic-aware one too)</li>
<li>Better pre-processing to identify and normalize Named Entities, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a future post, we're going to study the correlations between various headline structures and some external metrics such as the number of Shares and Likes on Social Media platforms, and see if we can uncover any interesting patterns.</p>
